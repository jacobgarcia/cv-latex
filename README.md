## Credit
[**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)** or **resume** or **cover letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.

### LaTeX
LaTeX is a fantastic typesetting program that a lot of people use these days, especially the math and computer science people in academia.
